YIQ takes into account the differences of perception between R, G, and B (red, green, and blue are not perceived equally by the human eye).

The below mixin normalizes each component of RGB and looks at the brightness/contrast to set the text color.

Color brightness and contrast is explained here - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WD-AERT/#color-contrast
*/

@function is-bright($color) {
  $yiq: ( (red($color) * 299) + (green($color) * 587) + (blue($color) * 114) ) / 1000;

  /*
  128 is half of 256 (max brightness as perceived by the human eye)
  Thus, if backgorund is more than half lightness (closer to 256 than 0), make the text dark
  */

  @if ($yiq >= 128) {
    @return true;
  } @else {
    @return false;
  }
}
